These 6 projects reflect the lessons I learned over a few days about 3D. All the functions were created from scratch without reference to any other 3D render/animation source code. That means there must be a better way to do it. However, what I learned from this exersize is invaluable knowledge for future projects.

Each project is built upon the satisfactory completion of the the previous one. 

Finally is a little fun program, more like a screen saver, glowsquares.exe. It is a cut back version of the projects.
